# Ball Animation Project

This is a simple ball animation project developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, leveraging the Web Animations API. The project includes controls for playing, pausing, reversing, and adjusting the speed of the animation.

## Features

- **Play/Pause Button**: Start and stop the animation with ease.
- **Reverse Button**: Play the animation in reverse.
- **Speed Control**: Speed up or slow down the animation.
- **SVG Ball**: A visually appealing ball created using SVG.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The HTML structure of the project.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling.
- `app.js`: The JavaScript file containing the animation logic.

## Getting Started

To run this project, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Controls

- **Play Button**: Starts or resumes the animation at normal speed.
- **Pause Button**: Pauses the animation.
- **Reverse Button**: Reverses the animation direction.
- **Speed Up Button**: Doubles the speed of the animation.
- **Slow Down Button**: Halves the speed of the animation.

## How It Works

The project uses the Web Animations API to animate an SVG ball. The animation rotates the ball 360 degrees and changes its color at different points in the animation.

- **Keyframes**: Define the stages of the animation, including rotation and color changes.
- **Options**: Specify the duration and iterations of the animation.
- **Controls**: Use JavaScript to interact with the animation, allowing play, pause, reverse, speed up, and slow down functionality.
